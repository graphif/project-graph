      This value determines the maximum number of times you can undo (Ctrl+Z).
      If your computer has very little memory, you can appropriately reduce this value.
  compressPastedImages:
    title: Compress Images Pasted to the Stage
    description: |
      When enabled, images pasted to the stage will be compressed to save memory and disk pressure when loading files.
  maxPastedImageSize:
    title: Pasted Image Size Limit (Pixels)
    description: |
      If the length or width exceeds this size, the maximum value of its length or width will be limited to this size.
      The aspect ratio remains unchanged, and it only takes effect when "Compress Images Pasted to the Stage" is enabled.
  isPauseRenderWhenManipulateOvertime:
    title: Pause Rendering when Stage is Idle for a Certain Time
    description: |
      When enabled, rendering will pause if no stage operation is performed for a few seconds, saving CPU/GPU resources.
  renderOverTimeWhenNoManipulateTime:
    title: Time (seconds) to Stop Rendering Stage when Idle
    description: |
      Rendering will stop if no stage operation is performed for a certain time, saving CPU/GPU resources.
      This only takes effect when the "Pause Rendering when Stage is Idle" option is enabled.
  ignoreTextNodeTextRenderLessThanCameraScale:
    title: Do not render text and details inside text nodes when camera scale is less than a certain value
    description: |
      When enabled, when the camera scale is less than a certain value (i.e., observing the macro state),
      the text and details inside text nodes will not be rendered, which improves rendering performance but results in the text content of the text nodes not being displayed.
  isEnableEntityCollision:
    title: Entity Collision Detection
    description: |
      When enabled, entities will collide and push each other, which may affect performance.
      It is recommended to disable this option, as entity collision is currently imperfect and may cause stack overflow.
  autoRefreshStageByMouseAction:
    title: Auto Refresh Stage on Mouse Action
    description: |
      When enabled, mouse actions (dragging to move the view) will automatically refresh the stage.
      This prevents the need for manual refresh if images fail to load after opening a file.
  autoNamerTemplate:
    title: Auto Namer Template
    description: |
      Enter `{{i}}` to automatically replace the node name with a number, which auto-increments on double-click creation.
      For example, `n{{i}}` will be automatically replaced with `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, etc.
      Enter `{{date}}` to automatically replace with the current date, which auto-updates on double-click creation.
      Enter `{{time}}` to automatically replace with the current time, which auto-updates on double-click creation.
      Can be combined, e.g., `{{i}}-{{date}}-{{time}}`.
  autoNamerSectionTemplate:
    title: Auto Namer Section Template
    description: |
      Enter `{{i}}` to automatically replace the node name with a number, which auto-increments on double-click creation.
      For example, `n{{i}}` will be automatically replaced with `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, etc.
      Enter `{{date}}` to automatically replace with the current date, which auto-updates on double-click creation.
      Enter `{{time}}` to automatically replace with the current time, which auto-updates on double-click creation.
      Can be combined, e.g., `{{i}}-{{date}}-{{time}}`.
  autoSaveWhenClose:
    title: Automatically save project file when clicking the window close button (top right)
    description: |
      When closing the software, if there are unsaved project files, a prompt will pop up asking whether to save.

      Automatically clear the operation history when manually saving the file with the Ctrl+S shortcut key.
      Enabling this option can reduce memory usage and keep the interface tidy.
  autoBackup:
    title: Enable Auto Backup
    description: |
      Automatically back up the current file.
      Auto backup will generate a copy next to the project file.
      If it is a draft, it will be stored in the specified path.
  autoBackupInterval:
    title: Auto Backup Interval (seconds)
    description: |
      Too frequent auto backups may generate a large number of backup files,
      which in turn occupy disk space.
  autoBackupDraftPath:
    title: Auto Backup Folder Path for Drafts
    description: |
      Please fill in the absolute path. Drafts will be backed up uniformly to this folder.
      No backup will be performed if left blank or the path is incorrect.
      Note the use of backslashes for Windows systems.
      For example: C:\Users\username\Documents\DraftBackup
      Do not end with a path separator.
  autoBackupLimitCount:
    title: Auto Backup Maximum Count
    description: |
      The maximum number of auto backups. Exceeding this number will delete the older backup files.
  scaleExponent:
    title: View Zoom Speed
    description: |
      The "Current Scale" will continuously approach the "Target Scale" at a certain rate.
      When close enough (less than 0.0001), the scaling will automatically stop.
      A value of 1 means the scaling will complete immediately, with no transition effect.
      A value of 0 means the scaling will never complete, simulating a lock effect.
      Note: If you experience lag when zooming, please set it to 1.
  cameraKeyboardScaleRate:
    title: Camera Zoom Keyboard Rate
    description: |
      The view zoom factor each time the view is zoomed using a single key press.
      A value of 0.2 means each zoom in will be 1.2 times the original, and zoom out will be 0.8 times the original.
      A value of 0 means disabling keyboard zooming.
  scaleCameraByMouseLocation:
    title: View Zoom Based on Mouse Position
    description: |
      When enabled, the center point for view zooming is the mouse position.
      When disabled, the center point for view zooming is the center of the current view.
  allowMoveCameraByWSAD:
    title: Allow Camera Movement with W S A D Keys
    description: |
      When enabled, you can use the W S A D keys to move the view up, down, left, and right.
      When disabled, you can only use the mouse to move the view, avoiding the infinite scrolling bug.
  cameraFollowsSelectedNodeOnArrowKeys:
    title: View Follows Movement when Switching Selected Node with Arrow Keys
    description: |
      When enabled, the view follows the movement when using the keyboard to move the node selection box.
  cameraKeyboardMoveReverse:
    title: Camera Movement Keyboard Reverse
    description: |
      When enabled, the movement direction of the W S A D keys will be reversed.
      The original movement logic is to move the camera hovering over the screen, but if viewed as moving the entire stage, it's reversed.
      Hence, this option exists.
  cameraResetViewPaddingRate:
    title: Edge Padding Coefficient when Resetting View Based on Selected Nodes
    description: |
      After selecting a bunch of nodes or a single node and pressing the shortcut key or button to reset the view,
      the view will adjust its size and position to ensure all selected content is centered and fully covered on the screen.
      Due to the view scaling size, there may be padding at the edges.
      A value of 1 means no padding at all. (Very close observation)
      A value of 2 means the padding content is exactly one time the content itself.
  allowAddCycleEdge:
    title: Allow Adding Self-Loops Between Nodes
    description: |
      When enabled, nodes can add self-loops, meaning a node connects to itself, used for state machine drawing.
      Default is disabled because it is not commonly used and is prone to accidental triggers.
  autoLayoutWhenTreeGenerate:
    title: Auto Update Layout when Generating Nodes
    description: |
      When enabled, the layout is automatically updated when generating nodes.
      Generating nodes here refers to growing nodes with the Tab and \ keys.
  moveAmplitude:
    title: View Movement Acceleration
    description: |
      This setting is used for the scenario of moving the view up, down, left, and right using the W S A D keys.
      The camera can be seen as a hovering airplane that can spray air in four directions.
      This acceleration value represents the power of the spray, and the speed needs to be adjusted in combination with the friction setting below.
  moveFriction:
    title: View Movement Friction Coefficient
    description: |
      This setting is used for the scenario of moving the view up, down, left, and right using the W S A D keys.
      A larger friction coefficient means a smaller sliding distance, and a smaller friction coefficient means a longer sliding distance.
      A value of 0 represents absolute smoothness.
  gamepadDeadzone:
    title: Gamepad Deadzone
    description: |
      This setting is used for the scenario of controlling the view with a gamepad.
      The gamepad input value is between 0 and 1. The smaller this value, the more sensitive the gamepad input.
      A larger deadzone means the gamepad input tends towards 0 or 1, and there will not be too much change.
      A smaller deadzone means the gamepad input tends towards the intermediate value, and there will be a larger change.
